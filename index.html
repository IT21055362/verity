                                                                various sectors of society. Deepfake images, a subset of synthetic media, are artificially created or manipulated visual
                                                                content generated through sophisticated artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, particularly deep
                                                                learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs). These technologies have enabled the production of highly
                                                                realistic fake images that can be nearly indistinguishable from authentic photographs to the human eye.
                                                                The creation of deepfake images typically involves training AI models on large datasets of real images, allowing the
                                                                system to learn and replicate patterns, textures, and features with remarkable accuracy. This process can be used to
                                                                generate entirely new, yet convincingly realistic images of people who don't exist, or to manipulate existing images
                                                                by swapping faces, altering expressions, or changing various elements within the picture.
                                                                While deepfake technology has some positive applications in fields such as entertainment, art, and education, its
                                                                potential for misuse has raised alarming concerns among experts, policymakers, and the general public. The

                                                                The most pressing concern is the potential for deepfakes to be used as a tool for spreading false information. In an era
                                                                where visual content plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, the ability to create convincing fake images of
                                                                events that never occurred or manipulate existing images to change their context poses a significant threat to informed
                                                                decision-making and democratic processes.
                                                                Deepfake technology enables the creation of synthetic images featuring real individuals without their knowledge or

                                                                The rise of deepfake images presents complex legal and ethical questions regarding accountability, intellectual

                                                                unique challenges posed by this technology.
                                                                In an article written by Raza et al.[], they present a novel approach to deepfake image detection using deep learning
                                                                techniques. The authors, introduce a hybrid model called the Deepfake Predictor (DFP), which combines VGG16 and
                                                                convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures.
                                                                The study begins by highlighting the growing threat of deepfakes in cybersecurity, emphasizing their potential for

                                                                In a systematic literature review Iftikhar Hussain et al. [] conducted w on existing methods and challenges in
                                                                deepfake detection. They highlighted key techniques such as CNN-based approaches utilizing pre-trained models like
                                                                XceptionNet and EfficientNet, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for detecting temporal inconsistencies in video
                                                                deepfakes, transfer learning models like EfficientNet and MobileNet, and statistical-based methods that identify
                                                                artifacts using spectral and spatial inconsistencies.
                                                                While significant progress has been made in developing deepfake detection techniques, several challenges remain.
                                                                These include dataset imbalance, adversarial attacks, and the need for real-time detection. To address these challenges,
                                                                researchers recommend developing hybrid models that combine CNNs with RNNs or statistical methods, creating

                                                                In an article presented by Yogesh Patel et al.[], they propose a novel deep convolutional neural network (D-CNN)
                                                                architecture for detecting deepfake images. The authors aim to address the growing challenge of identifying synthetic

                                                                detection approaches into three as Physical feature-based methods, Signal-level feature extraction techniques and
                                                                Data-driven models using deep neural networks
                                                                Further they note that while data-driven CNN models have shown promising results, many still struggle with
                                                                generalizability when faced with different types of deepfakes. To address this, their proposed D-CNN architecture is
                                                                designed to improve generalizability by training on images from multiple diverse deepfake sources.
                                                                The proposed model utilizes dense convolutional layers to extract deep features from input images. It incorporates
                                                                techniques like batch normalization and dropout to enhance training stability and reduce overfitting. The architecture
                                                                is thoroughly described, including details on the number and types of layers used.
                                                                Experimental results demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving high accuracy (95-99%) across multiple
                                                                deepfake datasets. The authors conduct additional experiments to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data,
                                                                further validating its generalizability.
                                                                Further in an article written by Guarnera L. et al[], provides an overview of deepfake detection methods and presents
                                                                results from a deepfake detection challenge. They describe deep fake images as AI-generated fake multimedia content,
                                                                have emerged as a significant concern and research challenge. To support this research, various datasets like DFDC,
                                                                FaceForensics++, and Celeb-DF have been developed, growing in size and diversity over time.
                                                                The authors categorize the deepfake detection methods into three categories deep learning-based, physical-based, and
                                                                physiological-based approaches. Also, they discuss on Deep learning techniques, such as EfficientNet and vision

                                                                domain or DCT coefficients.
                                                                Further they highlight that while progress has been made, creating robust and generalizable deepfake detectors remains
                                                                an active area of research. The challenge results demonstrate some of the current capabilities and limitations of state-

                                                                This literature review explores the landscape of deepfake image technology and detection methods. It highlights the
                                                                growing concern surrounding deepfakes, which are artificially created or manipulated images generated through
                                                                advanced AI techniques. The review outlines various approaches to deepfake detection, including deep learning-based
                                                                methods, hybrid models, and techniques focusing on physical, signal-level, and physiological features.
                                                                Notable advancements in detection methods are discussed, such as the Deepfake Predictor (DFP) model and other
                                                                CNN-based approaches. These methods have shown promising results, with some achieving high accuracy rates on

                                                        <p> The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies has led to the proliferation of
                                                            deepfake images, presenting significant challenges to digital media authenticity and security. While several studies
                                                            have explored deepfake detection techniques, there remains a critical gap in developing comprehensive, context-
                                                            specific solutions, particularly for regions like Sri Lanka. This research aims to address these gaps by proposing a
                                                            hybrid model that combines existing deepfake image detection techniques with convolutional neural networks
                                                            (CNN) and transfer learning methods.
                                                            Despite the commendable efforts that have been made to tackle the challenges of deepfake image detection, a critical
                                                            research gap persists, impeding the development of comprehensive solutions. This gap can be defined by a set of
                                                            key challenges that remain unaddressed within the current field of deepfake image detection, which are listed below:
                                                            1. Context-Specific Models: Current deepfake detection models often lack adaptability to specific cultural and
                                                            regional contexts. In the case of Sri Lanka, there is a notable absence of models tailored to the unique
                                                            digital landscape, linguistic nuances, and cultural specificities of the region.
                                                            2. Hybrid Model Optimization: While some research has explored hybrid approaches, there is a lack of
                                                            models that effectively combine multiple detection techniques in a way that maximizes their collective
                                                            strengths. The optimization of hybrid models for deepfake detection remains an underexplored area.
                                                            3. Transfer Learning: The application of transfer learning in deepfake detection, particularly for adapting
                                                            models to new contexts or limited datasets, is not fully realized. There is a need for more efficient transfer
                                                            learning methods that can quickly adapt pre-trained models to specific regional contexts like Sri Lanka.
                                                            4. Efficient Detection Capabilities: Many existing models focus on post-hoc analysis rather than real-time
                                                            detection. There is a pressing need for solutions that can identify deepfakes in real-time, especially given
                                                            the rapid spread of manipulated media on social platforms.
                                                            To address the identified research gaps and challenges in deepfake image detection, this research component
                                                            proposes the development of an innovative hybrid deepfake image detection model. This model aims to combine the
                                                            strengths of existing detection methods with advanced deep learning techniques.
                                                            The proposed solution centers around the creation of a hybrid architecture that integrates established deepfake
                                                            detection methods, such as the DenseNet121 model, with custom convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
                                                            DenseNet121 has shown promising results in image classification tasks due to its dense connectivity pattern, which
                                                            allows for more efficient feature reuse and improved gradient flow. By incorporating this proven architecture, the
                                                            model leverages its ability to extract features from images.
                                                            The integration of custom CNNs alongside DenseNet121 allows for the development of specialized layers tailored to
                                                            the unique characteristics of deepfake images. These custom CNN layers can be designed to focus on specific
                                                            artifacts or inconsistencies commonly found in manipulated images, such as unnatural blending boundaries,
                                                            inconsistent lighting, or anomalies in facial features. This hybrid approach aims to create a novel and robust
                                                            detection system capable of identifying a wider range of deepfake techniques. A key innovation in this proposed
                                                            model is the application of transfer learning techniques to fine-tune the hybrid architecture for specific contexts.
                                                            The model development process will occur in two distinct phases. Initially, the hybrid model will be trained on a
                                                            large, diverse dataset representing a global context. This dataset will include a wide variety of deepfake images from
                                                            different sources. The goal of this phase is to develop a strong foundational model capable of detecting deepfakes.
                                                            After achieving a high level of accuracy in the global context, the model will undergo a fine-tuning phase using a
                                                            smaller, dataset specific to the Sri Lankan context. This dataset will include images featuring Sri Lankan faces and
                                                            the fine-tuning process will adapt the model's learned features related to the Sri Lankan facial characteristics.

                                                        <p> When designing a system to detect misinformation, several critical factors must be 
                                                            considered, particularly in the realm of political misinformation on social media 
                                                            platforms like Twitter. While extensive research has been conducted on computational 
                                                            approaches to misinformation detection, a significant gap remains in effectively 
                                                            addressing the unique challenges posed by political misinformation, especially in the 
                                                            context of Twitter. This section will discuss the intricacies of the proposed system and 
                                                            compare it with existing approaches, highlighting how our system aims to bridge this 
                                                            5 
                                                            gap. 
                                                            Existing Twitter-based misinformation detection methods often fall short in several key 
                                                            areas. A notable limitation is their inadequate handling of the nuanced language 
                                                            typically used in political propaganda. Political misinformation often involves 
                                                            sophisticated rhetoric, subtle insinuations, and context-specific references, which can 
                                                            easily bypass traditional detection algorithms. Furthermore, many of these systems 
                                                            overly rely on external sources that are not always verified, which compromises the 
                                                            accuracy and reliability of the detection process. Additionally, these systems rarely 
                                                            incorporate mechanisms to validate claims against well-established and credible 
                                                            references, resulting in a higher likelihood of false positives or missed detections. 
                                                            In the specific context of Sri Lanka, research on political misinformation detection is 
                                                            notably sparse. Few studies have been conducted, leaving a significant void in this 
                                                            critical area. Among the limited research, Lalinda et al. developed a hybrid approach 
                                                            that combines content-based analysis with social network-based analysis to detect fake 
                                                            news in Sinhala text. This approach, while innovative, requires substantial preprocessing 
                                                            steps, such as feature extraction and network analysis, to function effectively. Another 
                                                            noteworthy study by Rahul et al. proposed a technique based on an autoencoder model 
                                                            to detect fake news. This method is particularly interesting as it captures patterns in data 
                                                            without requiring a labeled dataset, which is often a limitation in supervised learning 
                                                            models. However, like Lalinda et al.'s approach, it also demands significant 
                                                            preprocessing, which can be resource-intensive and time-consuming. 
                                                            Our proposed system seeks to overcome these limitations by adopting an end-to-end 
                                                            Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, which eliminates the need for extensive 
                                                            feature extraction and preprocessing. This model will directly process raw text data, 
                                                            learning to identify patterns and nuances in the language used in political 
                                                            misinformation on Twitter. By utilizing an RNN, our system can more effectively 
                                                            capture the temporal dependencies and context-specific language patterns that are often 
                                                            present in political propaganda. This approach not only streamlines the detection process 
                                                            but also enhances the system's ability to adapt to the evolving nature of misinformation.

                                                            A key innovation of our proposed system is the incorporation of external validation 
                                                            mechanisms from credible news sources. This feature will serve as a critical layer of 
                                                            verification, helping to ensure that the detected content is cross-referenced with 
                                                            trustworthy information. This step is particularly important in the context of political 
                                                            misinformation, where the stakes are high, and the consequences of false positives can 
                                                            be significant. 
                                                            Moreover, our system will be specifically fine-tuned to address the local context of Sri 
                                                            Lanka. Given the linguistic and cultural specificities of the region, we will create a 
                                                            small, dedicated dataset by collecting tweets in the Sinhala language. This dataset will 
                                                            be instrumental in training and optimizing our model, ensuring that it is not only 
                                                            effective in general scenarios but also tailored to the unique characteristics of the Sri

                                                            In summary, our project aims to fill the existing gaps in political misinformation 
                                                            detection on Twitter by developing a novel system that is both context-aware and 
                                                            technically advanced. By addressing the shortcomings of prior approaches and 
                                                            introducing new features such as end-to-end RNN processing and external validation, 
                                                            our system represents a significant advancement in the field. This innovation is expected 
                                                            to greatly enhance the accuracy and reliability of political misinformation detection, 
                                                            particularly in challenging environments like Twitter.

                                                        <p> Identifying research gaps is crucial for guiding the direction of any study, particularly in the 
                                                            realm of clickbait detection. A research gap in this context refers to areas within clickbait 
                                                            detection that have not yet been thoroughly examined or explored. The identification of such 
                                                            gaps aids researchers in determining the scope of their study and in uncovering new avenues 
                                                            for inquiry. In this study, several unique aspects of the suggested system for clickbait detection 
                                                            have been identified, including the utilization of advanced machine learning techniques, 
                                                            linguistic analysis, and user engagement metrics. However, despite the existing literature on 
                                                            clickbait detection, there remain gaps in understanding the effectiveness of semi-supervised 
                                                            learning techniques, the impact of contextual analysis on detection accuracy, and the

                                                            comparing and contrasting the proposed system with existing research papers, this study aims 
                                                            to identify these research gaps and stimulate further exploration into novel methodologies and 
                                                            approaches for combating clickbait in online forums.  
                                                            The [1] first research paper detects clickbaits using supervised learning but overlooks the 
                                                            utilization of natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text analysis and classification. 
                                                            This represents a notable gap in research, as NLP methods offer advanced capabilities for 
                                                            understanding textual data, potentially enhancing detection accuracy. Additionally, the paper 
                                                            fails to explore the application of supervised learning specifically for clickbait detection, 
                                                            indicating another gap. Moreover, the research does not address the context of Sri Lanka, which 
                                                            presents unique linguistic and cultural characteristics influencing clickbait prevalence. Future 
                                                            research should integrate NLP techniques, explore supervised learning's efficacy, and consider 
                                                            Sri Lanka's context for tailored detection approaches in online forums.  
                                                            The [3] second paper employs unsupervised learning for clickbait detection but neglects the 
                                                            potential of using natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text analysis. This is a 
                                                            significant gap, as NLP methods offer sophisticated tools for understanding textual data, 
                                                            potentially improving detection accuracy. Additionally, the paper does not explore 
                                                            semisupervised learning for clickbait detection, indicating another gap. Moreover, it does not 
                                                            consider the Sri Lankan context, which introduces unique linguistic and cultural factors. Future 
                                                            research should integrate NLP techniques, explore semi-supervised learning, and consider Sri 
                                                            Lanka's context for tailored detection approaches in online forums.

                                                            The [2] third paper detects clickbaits using supervised learning and employs NLP techniques 
                                                            for text analysis. However, it overlooks the potential of semi-supervised learning for clickbait 
                                                            detection. This gap is significant as semi-supervised methods could improve accuracy, 
                                                            especially with limited labeled data. Additionally, the paper does not consider the Sri Lankan 
                                                            context, which may influence clickbait prevalence. Future research should explore 
                                                            semisupervised learning and account for Sri Lanka's cultural factors in clickbait detection for
